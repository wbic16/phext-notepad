Welcome to the Terse
--------------------

Terse Notepad provides a reference implementation of multi-dimensional text using Lower ASCII dimension breaks. The format was created by Will Bickford, and is intended to assist humans with leaning into the Singularity.

Knowledge Trees
---------------
Terse files extend line breaks to additional dimensions. Everything that's great about text survives this transition. The .t format does not require any addressing or encoding rules. Scrolls provide you with infinite freedom to tinker and think. You can bundle up a set of scrolls and share them with others - while preserving the relational structure of your ideas.

High-Bandwidth I/O
------------------
For most of human history, we've been exchanging ideas at tragically slow rates. If you read very quickly, you might hit 3 bytes per second of compressed text. This is essentially a biological limit, but not one that will survive forever.

PCIe 5.0 SSDs are now providing us with 2-10 GB/sec data transfer speeds. For small files, these disks can sustain 200 MB/sec. Considering that text is highly-compressible, we now have access to disks that can transfer an effective 1 trillion words per minute.

  10 GB/sec x 10:1 compression ratio x 60sec/min
  ---------------------------------------------- = 1 trillion words/min
                  6 bytes/word

If you typed at 120 wpm for 15,000 years (without rest), you would only hit 950 billion words (5.7 GB). We now have an abundance of disk I/O at our disposal. It is time to re-think how we design our systems - the days of worrying about files measured in KB or MB are gone.

Machine Learning
----------------
Terse files are well-suited for machine learning, as they provide structure and context free of parsing concerns. This makes Terse files very robust. If a page becomes corrupted, a parser can easily skip past it. Perhaps the best way to think about Terse files is to consider them an anonymous collection of scrolls that someone shipped to you.
